These pages tagged with **[#CUDA](https://svvj.github.io/tags.html#CUDA)** summarizes my study of the book "[CUDA Parallel Programming](https://product.kyobobook.co.kr/detail/S000001019500)". This page explains what CUDA is and why I want to study it.

## What is CUDA?

**CUDA** (or **Compute Unified Device Architecture**) is a proprietary and closed source parallel computing platform and application programming interface (**API**) that allows software to use certain types of graphics processing units (**GPUs**) for general purpose processing, an approach called general-purpose computing on GPUs (**GPGPU**, General Purpose Graphics Processing Unit).

## Advantages of CUDA

The advantages of CUDA are as follows:
- High computational processing power
- Scalability of parallel programs
- Affordable price
- Convenient installation

## Why CUDA?

As a student majoring in computer graphics, I think this is an essential environment to learn and use. In particular, I realized the importance of parallel programming when working on personal projects such as rendering engine and physics engine development, and started this project to realize it.
